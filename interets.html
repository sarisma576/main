				<h5>Univeristy Institute of Technology !</h5>
				<p>I have always been interested in computer science since I was young.
				What was the biggest factor that played into my desire and passion for digital was,
				I think I was like the majority of cyber enthusiasts, it was series such as Mr.ROBOT,
				which is a bit close to the real world. What attracts me the most in pentesting is the power
				behind each computer. With a lot of knowledge and a good know-how. A good pentestor can be an
				indispensable asset in a company or a government. To act, in order to defend from multitudes of attacks
				coming from all over the world. I didn't know where to go in order to follow a well detailed training that
				will allow me to follow my passion, until I met a friend of mine who was a former student of the DUT R&T
				who is currently a cybersecurity consultant in Paris. That was the trigger for me, because he followed a
				well traced path that allowed him to acquire the necessary knowledge, as well as the right know-how to start
				his career in cybersecurity. </p>

			<h2>BRASILIAN JIU-JITSU</h2>

				<p>The Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (JJB) is a wrestling sport and martial art based on control techniques
				and ground submissions. We explain its principles and specificities. The objective is to neutralize
				his opponent by using techniques on the ground to obtain dominant positions or submissions 
				(joint key, strangulation, muscle compression) forcing his opponent to abandon the fight (without having to address the slightest blow).
				Originally developed as a self-defense system, the JJB was revealed worldwide with the first free fights organized in the United States,
				by imposing itself as an effective way to defeat a stronger opponent by bringing the fight to the ground. Subsequently, JJB developed as
				a full-fledged sport with competitions and federations around the world.
